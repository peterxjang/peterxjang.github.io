Such approaches seldom take into consideration physical process concerns or dynamic system limitations. In the present work, an approach for improving a geometrically feasible tool-path trajectory based on quantifiable process metrics is developed. Two specific measures of toolpath quality are incorporated into the iterative improvement algorithm: instantaneous path curvature and instantaneous cutter engagement. These metrics are motivated by a desire to minimize acceleration requirements and maintain a stable steady-state cutting process during high-speed machining. The algorithm has been implemented for two-dimensional contiguous end-milling operations with flat end-mills, and case studies are presented to illustrate the approach.</p>",
