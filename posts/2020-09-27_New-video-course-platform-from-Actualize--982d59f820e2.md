_Featured courses from Actualize First Class: [https://firstclass.actualize.co](https://firstclass.actualize.co)_

Just wanted to announce [Actualize First Class](https://firstclass.actualize.co), the new video course platform from [Actualize coding bootcamp](https://actualize.co)! These courses will cover topics for developers at every experience level, from beginners at the very start of their developer journey ([macOS for developers](https://firstclass.actualize.co/p/macos-for-developers)), to seasoned developers looking to deepen their understanding of specific technologies ([OAuth 2.0 Deconstructed](https://firstclass.actualize.co/p/oauth2-deconstructed)).

Right now courses include video versions of some of my most widely shared articles, [Modern JavaScript Explained For Dinosaurs](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/modern-javascript-explained-for-dinosaurs-f695e9747b70) and [Modern CSS Explained For Dinosaurs](https://medium.com/actualize-network/modern-css-explained-for-dinosaurs-5226febe3525). There will be more courses to come, you can follow me on Twitter [@peterxjang](https://twitter.com/peterxjang) for any updates!
